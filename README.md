# chatbots-zero-to-hero

This project aims to tackle different areas of building chatbots. With all the machine learning techniques of building a chatbot coming out everyday we forget the basic building blocks. This project aims to fix that by starting from a very basic bot and increasing the complexity step by step.

## Plan

**Implemented**

- [x] **Echo bot**: Echoes everything the user says
- [x] **Fixed Responses**: Responds with pre-programmed responses
- [x] **Randomized Responses**: Gets a random response for every pre-programmed question.


**Next**

- [ ] **Regex based**
- [ ] **Entity Recognition**
- [ ] **Sequence to Sequence**
- [ ] **Reinforcement Learning based**

> Disclaimer: This project was inspired by the first section of DataCamp chatbots 101 course.
